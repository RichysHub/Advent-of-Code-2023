Part 1

Each line is of format:
Game #: # color, # color ... ; # color, # color, # color ... /n
where each # could be a multidigit number
Well formatted input means we know when an integer is coming

Some things to note:
- every line starts "Game ", which we just toss
- Game number is colon terminated
- Three colors of cubes use consistant color words
- Colors each start with a different letter

Assume we have at least 1 game in input

Limits on allowed cube quantities:
12 red, 13 green, 14 blue 

first letters of colors, in ASCII
r = 114 = 98 + 17
g = 103 = 98 + 5 <- this sets our max modulus at 6
b = 98 = 98 + 0 

Integer division can get us some useful offsets to index on
r/6 = 19
g/6 = 17
b/6 = 16

for each of these indexes, we have 2 values stored on grid:
max number allowed (stored as # * 3)

r = 12 * 3 = 36 = $
g = 13 * 3 = 39 = '
b = 14 * 3 = 42 = *

and an offset, defined as number of letters in the color word -1

r = 2
g = 4
b = 3

Indexed characters are within the code space, and are used in execution when possible; the $ is used as a discard instruction, string mode is used to pass the other two safetly.

Pseudocode:

[begin]
Input and discard until the game number
Input game number with & operator
Input and discard the colon and space
Input # for color with &
Get first character of color
Advance through input until end of color word, using lookup value (ยง)
Lookup max allowed for color and compare
    If passes, loop back, unless newline or EOF
        If newline, add game # to count, back to [begin]
        If EOF, add game # to count, and output
    If fail, input and discard line until newline or EOF
        Newline: back to [begin]
        EOF, output

ยง looks a little out of order, but is done for reasons of stack: at that point

Stack

color index (color first letter/6)
# of color
Game #
Running total

If we compare first, we lose the color index, so we instead duplicate our index, move, then compare

number
letter
duplicate
fetch offset
move offset
fetch max for color
compare
process next character
